# acemc
a Matlab package for computing the electromagnetic environment of AC power lines.

This package was initially created around March 2007 when I was at the first year of my PhD.
The initial version had a Matlab GUI based on Matlab 6.5.1. Now the GUI was not supported any more by the newest Matlab.

The codes were optimized using Matlab's vectorization by me around 2009 following the self-cultivation of a progammer.

Code written by chijie@tsinghua.edu.cn and open sourced in 2024, in the hope that it can help somebody.
