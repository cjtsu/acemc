# acemc
a Matlab package for computing the electromagnetic environment of AC power lines.
This package was initially created around March 2007 when I was at the first year of my PhD.
The initial version had a Matlab GUI which was based on Matlab 6.5.1. Now the GUI was not supported any more.
The codes were optimized by me around 2009 based on the self-cultivation of a progammer, using Matlab's vectorizatoin.

Code written by chijie@tsinghua.edu.cn and open sourced in 2024 in the hope that it can help somebody.
